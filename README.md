# Fruitpunch AI code epoch-10: Convolutional Autoencoder
AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 10.
# Challenge description
In this challenge we discover a convolutional autoencoder and build an encoder and decoder on the MNIST dataset.
There are two options in this challenge:
 - Create an encoder yourself and a corresponding decoder (this is a harder and more creative challenge)
 - Create only the decoder based on a given encoder (when you are a beginner)


The data preprocessing and displaying the image is already included in the challenges. At the end you can view the generated number based on the trained model!
